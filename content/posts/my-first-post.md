## New place, new rules

I've decided to ressurect my personal page and blog in new place and move it to new static site generator. I've chousen the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Let's take a look how it will go.

Exaple of code blocks:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

My lovely python:

```python
import everything

for everywhere in everything:
    do.all_at_one()
```

My ugly bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Today is " `date`

echo -e "\nenter the path to directory"
read the_path

echo -e "\n you path has the following files and folders: "
ls $the_path
```
